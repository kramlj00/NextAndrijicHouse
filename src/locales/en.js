      comment: "The hosts, Tonƒçi and Ivana, a very kind young couple, were waiting for us when we arrived and welcomed us warmly. The apartment is located in a very quiet, but excellent environment for a relaxing holiday. The view from the terrace of the apartment and the concrete terrace for swimming is beautiful. The terrace for swimming has a large umbrella and sunbeds, a ladder for a comfortable entry into the sea and even a canoe. The apartment is modernly decorated, with an outdoor grill, another outdoor refrigerator, a large covered terrace, everything is really perfect. We even received a bottle of very good wine and olive oil as a gift, both homemade. It couldn't be more perfect, really great. It's a pity that we booked only 5 days."
